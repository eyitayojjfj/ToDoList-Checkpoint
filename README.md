# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are persisted using `localStorage` so that they remain between sessions.

## Features

- Add new tasks with name and description
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persist tasks in `localStorage`
- Form validation for adding/editing tasks

## How to Run

2. Navigate into the project directory:
3. Install the dependencies:
4. Start the development server:


The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Notes

- The tasks are stored in `localStorage` and are loaded when the app initializes.
- You can customize the styles in `styles.css` to better suit your preferences.
- This project uses React hooks for state management and functional components for simplicity.
